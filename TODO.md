### Todo

- project-report Analysis
  - Plan/Research
  - Use all theory behind projects (maths etc)
  - Interview end-user (Microsoft Form to AI person)
- Continue adding Deep Model
  - Add ReLu support
  - Document theory behind model
  - Try on images
    - Create pre-trained weights with desktop (maybe with GPU), so that can load in and use on laptop (if computation is high)
