### Todo

- Code
  - Is dataset / does it need to be normalised, or need NOT NULL specification?
  - Make UI nicer? (Use customtkinter?)
  - Memory Leak issue
  - Maybe
    - Save optimum models
    - Give option to continue training pretrained model
    - Add ability to add external .npz file

- Report
  - Objective trace table (obj, brief description, link to section in document, maybe link to where tested)
  - Evaluation
    - Third party feedback
      - Email interviewee
      - Maybe create questions for interviewee?
    - Future improvement ideas
      - Give option to continue training pretrained model (maybe with different learning rate to get out of wrong local minima?~)
      - Add ability to add external .npz file
      - Option to use trained model for personal use (upload own picture?)
  - Mention time complexity in report, speed times of saving and loading

- Remove memory leak mentioning
- Update setup.py version
