### Todo

- Finish analysis draft
  - Complete analysis interview
  - Update Matrice theory
  - Change multiply from * to x/. ?
  - Format images to correct sections
  - Submit to Teams

- Add support for no hidden layers?
  - Remove perceptron + shallow models?

- Update MakeFile
- Remove 'docs/'

- Allow CPU to train and compare to GPU?

- Allow weights to be saved in files with sqlite3?
  - Pretrained optimum?

- Update GUI
  - Options over model parameters
    - Transfer functions
    - Network shape
    - Epoch count
  - Cancel training button?
  - Training progress display
  - Comparison of models
  - left=options, right=train

- Ideas from interview
  - Validation set
    - Monitors how well network is predicting, to see when network becomes overtrained
  - cifar-10 dataset
  - Use sections of images for more inputs
  - Browse through more of results
    - Show images predicted correct
    - Show images predicted wrong
    - Show images where prediction is close between muliple classes
  - Play around with size of training datasets
    - Graph showing performance against increase in training data
  - Maybe CNNs

- Update README

- Jupyter notebook for technical presentation?
