### Todo

- project-report Analysis
  - Plan/Research
  - Use all theory behind projects (maths etc)
  - Interview end-user (Microsoft Form to AI person)
- Continue adding Deep Model
  - Document theory behind model
  - Try on images
    - If deep cat recognition doesn't work, just leave a perceptron
    - Increase number recognition training epochs (to improve from 94% accuracy at 50 epochs)
    - Setup default values for cat recognition
    - Create pre-trained weights with desktop (maybe with GPU), so that can load in and use on laptop (if computation is high)
      - Can store files with sqlite3 etc
  - Try using GPUS to train on desktop (maybe via remote access (website hosted on local host))
  - Try giving option for more types of transfer functions (then can compare if wanted)
- Add options menu vs train menu
- Change hidden layer control to
  - layers shape stored as array
  - Display shape
  - Buttons to add layer, with neuron count and transfer type (use vs don't use relu)
- Show training progress ?
- Add stop-training button?
- Add epoch count control?
- Add prediction correctness to MNIST model?
