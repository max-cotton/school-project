### Todo

- Start project-report Analysis
 - Plan/Research
 - Use already done theory if possible in analysis
- Try using Shallow Model for Image Recognition (maybe change hidden transfer function to ReLu for faster change)
- Try creating Deep ANN so can add more layers
  - Learn new maths
  - Try adding more customising to ANNs (layer count, layer shape, neuron count, learning rate, transfer function used) (Dr.Grey's suggestion - The more the better)
- Create pre-trained weights with desktop (maybe with GPU), so that can load in and use on laptop (Eg: for higher computaion such as deep networks on images)
