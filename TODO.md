### Todo

- Report
  - Evaluation
    - Third party feedback
      - Maybe create questions for interviewee?
      - Maybe ask opinion on how completed objectives are?
    - Future improvement ideas
      - Give option to continue training pretrained model (maybe with different learning rate to get out of wrong local minima?~)
      - Add ability to add external .npz file
      - Option to use trained model for personal use (upload own picture?)
      - Will's suggestions:
        - To repeat tests for accuracy
        - Use a standardized way of storing neural networks (file)
        - CNNs
        - Training data augmentation (adding noise, cropping images) for more training data
