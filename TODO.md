### Todo

- project-report Analysis
  - Plan/Research
  - Use all theory behind projects (maths etc)
  - Interview end-user (Microsoft Form to AI person)
- Continue adding Deep Model
  - Document theory behind model
  - Try on images
    - Increase number recognition training epochs (to improve from 94% accuracy at 50 epochs)
    - Create pre-trained weights with desktop (maybe with GPU), so that can load in and use on laptop (if computation is high)
  - Try giving option for more types of transfer functions (then can compare if wanted)
