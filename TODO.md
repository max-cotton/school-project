### Todo

- project-report Analysis
  - Plan/Research
  - Use already done theory if possible in analysis
  - Interview end-user (Microsoft Form to AI person)
- Add ReLu to Shallow Network (Test on XOR)
  - Then test Shallow Network on image recognition
- Try creating Deep ANN so can add more layers
  - Learn new maths
  - Each layer will be a FullyConnected layer as a class (consisting of the layer's weights, biases and forward + back propagation (including the activation function))
  - Try adding more customising to ANNs (layer shape, transfer function used) (Dr.Grey's suggestion - The more the better)
  - Create pre-trained weights with desktop (maybe with GPU), so that can load in and use on laptop (if computation is high)
