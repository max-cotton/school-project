About AI:
. Artificial Intelligence (AI) mimics human cognition in order to perform tasks and learn from them
. Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that uses algorithms trained on data to produce adaptable models (trained programs)
. Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
. The focus of this project will be on creating ANNs from scratch and applying them to image recognition, such as recognising numbers from images
