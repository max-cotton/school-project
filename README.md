# Year 13 Computer Science Programming Project
## About
This project focuses on learning Artificial Neural Networks and their applications

## Run
Run with 'python3 school_project' and option '--xor' to run the XOR model

## Dev Setup
- Create a virtualenv with 'python3 -m venv {venv name}'
- Use 'source ./venv/bin/activate' to enter venv
- Use pip as normal in the venv
- Use 'python3 setup.py develop' to setup preferences of setup.py (install package to venv in developing mode)
### Tests
- Use 'python3 -m unittest discover school_project/test/' to run tests
### Documentation
- 

## TODO
- Setup project plan and theory (with images) with latex
- Create XOR model
- Longterm aim to develop image recognition model and a final application with a UI and specific focus
