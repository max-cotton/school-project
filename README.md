# Year 13 Computer Science Programming Project

## About
This project focuses on image recognition, by creating Artificial Neural Networks from scratch and applying them to problems, such as recognising numbers from images.

## Run
Run with 'python3 school_project'

## Dev Setup
- Create a virtualenv with 'python3 -m venv {venv name}'
- Use 'source ./venv/bin/activate' to enter venv
- Use pip as normal in the venv
- Use 'python3 setup.py develop' to setup preferences of setup.py (install package to venv in developing mode)
### Tests
- Use 'python3 -m unittest discover school_project/test/' to run tests
### Documentation
- Use 'make all' in 'docs/models/' to generate model theory PDFs
