\section{Introduction}

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of Computer Science that attempts to mimic human cognition in order to perform tasks, understand data and predict outcomes. 
\cite{hunt2014artificial}
Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that uses statistical algorithms, which take as an input training datasets, to produce mathematical models 
that allow prediction of the outcome of unseen datasets. Deep Learning is a further subfield of Machine Learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks, a process of 
learning from data inspired by the human brain. Artificial Neural Networks can be trained to operate on, "learn", a vast number of problems, such as Image Recognition, 
and have uses across multiple fields, such as medical imaging in hospitals.

\subsection{Project Aims}

This project is an investigation into how Artificial Neural Networks work, the effects of changing the hyper-parameters (such as the shape of the network and the 
learning rate) used to tune the models, and particularly their applications in Image Recognition. To achieve this, I have derived and researched all the fundamental 
theory behind the project, using sources such as IBM's online research, and developed Neural Networks from first principles without the use of any third-party Machine 
Learning libraries. I have then implemented the Artificial Neural Networks in the domain of Image Recognition, by creating trained models and have allowed for experimentation 
in varying the hyper-parameters of each model to provide for comparison and experimentation between different model performances. A Graphical User Interface has been developed 
to provide a mechanism for a researcher, or interested student, to train and test models and alter key hyper-parameters to explore the effect on performance and results.
