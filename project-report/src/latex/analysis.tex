\section*{About}

Artificial Intelligence mimics human cognition in order to perform tasks and learn from them, Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that uses 
algorithms trained on data to produce models (trained programs) and Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that uses Artificial Neural Networks, a process of 
learning from data inspired by the human brain. Artificial Neural Networks can be trained to learn a vast number of problems, such as Image Recognition, and have uses 
across multiple fields, such as medical imaging in hospitals. This project is an investigation into how Artificial Neural Networks work, the effects of changing their 
parameters and their applications in Image Recognition. To achieve this, I will derive and research all theory behind the project, using sources such as IBM's online 
research, and develop Neural Networks from first principles without the use of any third-party Machine Learning libraries. I then will implement the Artificial Neural 
Networks in Image Recognition, by creating trained models and will allow for experimentation of the parameters of each model to allow for comparisons between each 
model's performances, via a Graphical User Interface.
