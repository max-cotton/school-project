\subsubsection{Project Objective Evaluations}

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.13\linewidth}|p{0.75\linewidth}|p{0.12\linewidth}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Objective ID} & \textbf{Evaluation} & \textbf{Status} \\
    \hline
    1 & I have learnt how Artificial Neural Networks work from online resources, reports and interviewing a subject matter expert. I have proven the key mathematical principles from first principles 
        and implemented these structures within Python code. & Fully met \\
    \hline
    2 & I have implemented trainable Artificial Neural Networks with configurable numbers of layers, number of neurons in each layer and the nature of the Transfer Functions. The Artificial Neural 
        Networks have been trained and tested on a variety of datasets and operates at an accuracy level comparable with the resources learnt from. & Fully met \\
    \hline
    2.1 & The Artificial Neural Networks allow the use of a graphics card where applicable. & Fully met \\
    \hline
    2.2 & The trained Artificial Neural Networks' weights and biases can be saved to a data file and the features of the corresponding Artificial Neural Networks are saved to a database. These saved 
          Artificial Neural Networks can be loaded independently. & Fully met \\
    \hline
    3 & A Graphical User Interface allowing configuration of all hyper-parameters, loading and saving of trained models and testing has been developed. & Fully met \\
    \hline
    3.1 & The Graphical User Interface allows user configuration of all utilised model hyper-parameters. & Fully met \\
    \hline
    3.2 & The model predictions can be compared in terms of both learning rate and overall accuracy. & Fully met \\
